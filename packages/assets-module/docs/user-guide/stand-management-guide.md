- **Bulk Import**: Import hundreds of stands from CSV files
- **Real-time Updates**: See changes made by other users instantly
- **Advanced Search**: Find stands quickly with powerful search and filters
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes with comprehensive history
- **Role-based Access**: Control who can view and modify stands

## Getting Started

### Accessing Stand Management

1. Log in to the Capacity Planner application
2. Navigate to **Assets** â†’ **Stands** from the main menu
3. You'll see the Stand Management dashboard

### Understanding the Interface

![Stand Management Interface](./images/stand-management-overview.png)

The main interface consists of:

- **Search Bar**: Quick search by stand code or name
- **Filter Panel**: Advanced filtering options
- **Add Stand Button**: Create new stands
- **Import Button**: Bulk import from CSV
- **Data Table**: List of all stands with actions

### Required Permissions

To perform various actions, you need specific permissions:

- **View Stands**: `stands.read`
- **Create Stands**: `stands.create`
- **Update Stands**: `stands.update`
- **Delete Stands**: `stands.delete`
- **Import Stands**: `stands.import`

Contact your administrator if you need additional permissions.

## Managing Stands

### Creating a New Stand

1. Click the **"Add Stand"** button
2. Fill in the required information:
   - **Code**: Unique identifier (e.g., "A1", "B15")
   - **Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Alpha 1")
   - **Terminal**: Associated terminal (optional)
   - **Status**: Operational, Maintenance, or Closed

3. Add capability details (optional but recommended):
   - **Dimensions**: Length, width, and height
   - **Aircraft Compatibility**: Maximum wingspan, length, and compatible categories
   - **Ground Support**: Available services and equipment
   - **Operational Constraints**: Time restrictions and weather limits

4. Click **"Create Stand"** to save

#### Example: Creating a Wide-body Stand

```
Code: E5
Name: Echo 5 - Wide Body
Terminal: Terminal 2
Status: Operational

Dimensions:
- Length: 75m
- Width: 80m
- Height: 18m

Aircraft Compatibility:
- Max Wingspan: 80m
- Max Length: 76m
- Compatible Categories: D, E, F
- Specific Aircraft: A380, B777-300ER, A350-1000
```

### Viewing Stand Details

1. Click on any stand in the table to view details
2. The detail view shows:
   - Basic information
   - Full capability specifications
   - Maintenance history
   - Change history
   - Current utilization

### Updating a Stand

1. Click the **"Edit"** button next to the stand
2. Modify the desired fields
3. Click **"Update Stand"** to save changes

**Important**: The system uses optimistic locking. If another user has modified the stand while you were editing, you'll see a conflict message. Refresh and try again.

### Deleting a Stand

1. Click the **"Delete"** button next to the stand
2. Provide a reason for deletion (optional but recommended)
3. Confirm the deletion

**Note**: Stands are soft-deleted, meaning they're marked as deleted but retained for historical records.

## Bulk Import

### Preparing Your CSV File

Create a CSV file with the following columns:

```csv
code,name,terminal,status,length,width,height,maxWingspan,maxLength,maxWeight,categories
A1,Alpha 1,Terminal 1,operational,60,30,15,65,70,560000,"C,D,E"
A2,Alpha 2,Terminal 1,operational,55,28,14,60,65,450000,"B,C,D"
```

#### CSV Column Reference

| Column | Required | Description | Format |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| code | Yes | Unique stand identifier | Alphanumeric, max 10 chars |
| name | Yes | Stand name | Text, max 100 chars |
| terminal | No | Terminal assignment | Text, max 50 chars |
| status | No | Stand status | operational/maintenance/closed |
| length | No | Stand length | Number (meters) |
| width | No | Stand width | Number (meters) |
| height | No | Stand height clearance | Number (meters) |
| maxWingspan | No | Maximum aircraft wingspan | Number (meters) |
| maxLength | No | Maximum aircraft length | Number (meters) |
| maxWeight | No | Maximum aircraft weight | Number (kg) |
| categories | No | Compatible ICAO categories | Comma-separated list |

### Performing the Import

1. Click the **"Import Stands"** button
2. Select your CSV file
3. Review the preview to ensure data looks correct
4. Click **"Start Import"**
5. Monitor the progress:
   - Total rows to process
   - Successfully imported
   - Errors encountered

### Handling Import Errors

If errors occur during import:

1. Download the error report
2. Fix the issues in your CSV file
3. Re-import only the corrected rows

Common errors:
- **Duplicate code**: A stand with this code already exists
- **Invalid status**: Use only operational, maintenance, or closed
- **Invalid number format**: Ensure numeric fields contain only numbers

## Search and Filters

### Quick Search

Use the search bar to quickly find stands by:
- Stand code (e.g., "A1")
- Stand name (e.g., "Alpha")

Search is case-insensitive and finds partial matches.

### Advanced Filters

Click **"Filters"** to access advanced filtering:

1. **Status Filter**
   - Operational
   - Maintenance
   - Closed

2. **Terminal Filter**
   - Select one or multiple terminals

3. **Aircraft Category Filter**
   - Filter by compatible aircraft categories

4. **Dimension Filters**
   - Minimum/maximum length
   - Minimum/maximum wingspan

### Combining Filters

Filters work together (AND logic). For example:
- Status: Operational
- Terminal: Terminal 1
- Category: E

This shows only operational stands in Terminal 1 that can handle category E aircraft.

### Saving Filter Presets

1. Apply your desired filters
2. Click **"Save Filter Preset"**
3. Name your preset (e.g., "Wide-body Stands")
4. Access saved presets from the filter menu

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Stand has been modified by another user"

**Cause**: Someone else updated the stand while you were editing.

**Solution**:
1. Note your changes
2. Refresh the page
3. Re-apply your changes

#### Import fails with "Permission denied"

**Cause**: You don't have the `stands.import` permission.

**Solution**: Contact your administrator to grant import permissions.

#### Cannot see certain fields

**Cause**: Field-level permissions restrict access to sensitive data.

**Solution**: 
- Location data requires `stands.location` permission
- Infrastructure details require `stands.infrastructure` permission

#### Search returns no results

**Cause**: Filters may be too restrictive.

**Solution**:
1. Clear all filters
2. Try a broader search term
3. Check if you're in the correct organization

### Performance Tips

1. **Use filters** instead of scrolling through all stands
2. **Export filtered results** for offline analysis
3. **Batch similar updates** using the bulk import feature
4. **Avoid concurrent edits** to the same stand

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Establish consistent naming:
- **Codes**: Use systematic patterns (A1-A20, B1-B20)
- **Names**: Include terminal and type (e.g., "T2 Gate A1 - Narrow Body")

### Regular Maintenance

1. **Review stand status** weekly
2. **Update dimensions** when modifications occur
3. **Archive unused stands** instead of deleting
4. **Document changes** in the reason field

### Data Quality

1. **Complete all fields** for better search and filtering
2. **Verify aircraft compatibility** data regularly
3. **Use standard units** (meters for dimensions, kg for weight)
4. **Regular audits** of stand data accuracy

### Security Best Practices

1. **Limit permissions** to necessary personnel only
2. **Review audit logs** for unauthorized changes
3. **Use strong passwords** and enable 2FA
4. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

## FAQ

### Q: Can I recover a deleted stand?

A: Yes, deleted stands are soft-deleted. Contact your administrator to restore a deleted stand.

### Q: How often is data synchronized?

A: Data updates are real-time. Changes made by other users appear immediately.

### Q: What's the maximum number of stands I can import?

A: The system can handle imports of 10,000+ stands, but we recommend batches of 1,000 for optimal performance.

### Q: Can I export stand data?

A: Yes, use the **"Export"** button to download data in CSV format. Exports respect your current filters.

### Q: How do I track who made changes?

A: View the change history in the stand details, or contact an administrator for detailed audit logs.

### Q: Can I attach documents to stands?

A: This feature is planned for a future release. Currently, use the metadata field for reference information.

### Q: What happens if two people edit the same stand?

A: The system uses optimistic locking. The first person to save wins; the second person sees a conflict error and must refresh.

### Q: How do I report a bug or request a feature?

A: Use the feedback button in the application or contact support at support@capacity-planner.com
