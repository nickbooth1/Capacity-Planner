## Business Rules and Logic

### Status Transition Rules
1. **Operational → Maintenance**: When work request is approved and scheduled
2. **Maintenance → Operational**: When work is completed
3. **Operational → Closed**: For major work or safety issues
4. **Closed → Operational**: After major work completion and approval
5. **Any Status → Emergency**: For emergency work requests

### Impact-Based Status Changes
- **Full Closure**: Stand status changes to "Closed" for duration
- **Partial Restriction**: Stand status changes to "Maintenance" with restrictions
- **No Impact**: Stand status remains "Operational" with maintenance note

### Automatic Triggers
- **Work Request Approval**: Triggers future status change scheduling
- **Work Start**: Triggers immediate status change to "Maintenance"
- **Work Completion**: Triggers status change back to "Operational"
- **Work Cancellation**: Reverts scheduled status changes
- **Emergency Requests**: Immediate status change regardless of schedule
