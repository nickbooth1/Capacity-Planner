# Test Strategy Summary

## ✅ Test Strategy Implemented

The testing strategy has been successfully configured with the following features:

### 1. **Co-located Tests**
- Tests are stored alongside the files they test (not in separate test folders)
- Example structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── types/
  │   ├── stand-capabilities.ts
  │   └── stand-capabilities.spec.ts         # Unit test
  └── validation/
      ├── dimensions.validator.ts
      ├── dimensions.validator.spec.ts       # Unit test
      └── dimensions.validator.integration.spec.ts  # Integration test
  ```

### 2. **Test Naming Conventions**
- **Unit Tests**: `*.spec.ts`
- **Integration Tests**: `*.integration.spec.ts`
- **E2E Tests**: `*.e2e.spec.ts`

### 3. **Test Commands**
```bash
# Run all tests for assets module
pnpm test:assets

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:assets:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:assets:coverage

# Run all unit tests across monorepo
pnpm test:unit

# Run all integration tests across monorepo
pnpm test:integration

# Run all tests (unit + integration)
pnpm test:all

# Run specific test type for specific module
pnpm test:unit assets-module
pnpm test:integration assets-module
```

### 4. **Jest Configuration**
- Created `packages/assets-module/jest.config.js` with:
  - Co-located test patterns
  - Coverage thresholds (80% minimum)
  - Proper TypeScript support
  - Test setup file for mocks and utilities

### 5. **Test Setup**
- `test-setup.ts` provides:
  - Mocked PrismaClient for unit tests
  - Test environment variables
  - Global test utilities
  - Appropriate timeouts for different test types

### 6. **Example Tests Created**
1. **Type Definitions Test** (`stand-capabilities.spec.ts`)
   - Tests for all capability interfaces
   - Validates enum values
   - Ensures type structure integrity

2. **Unit Test Example** (`dimensions.validator.spec.ts`)
   - Tests validation logic in isolation
   - Covers all validation rules
   - Tests error and warning scenarios
   - 100% code coverage of validator

3. **Integration Test Example** (`dimensions.validator.integration.spec.ts`)
   - Performance testing (1000 stands validation)
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Real-world scenarios

### 7. **Test Infrastructure**
- Custom test runner script (`scripts/test-by-type.js`) for flexible test execution
- Nx integration for parallel test execution
- Coverage reporting configuration
- Mock setup for database and external dependencies

## Next Steps

Now that the test strategy is in place, you can:

1. Start implementing the Stand Capabilities feature
2. Write tests first (TDD approach) for each component
3. Ensure all code has accompanying tests
4. Run tests continuously during development
5. Check coverage before marking tasks complete

The testing foundation is ready to support the full implementation of the Stand Capabilities feature!
