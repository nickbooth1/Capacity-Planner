#### 4. Delete Stand Operations
- **Soft Delete**: Mark stands as deleted without data loss
- **Dependency Checking**: Prevent deletion of stands with active work requests
- **Audit Trail**: Log deletion activities with user attribution
- **Recovery Support**: Enable restoration of soft-deleted stands

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Bulk Import System
- **CSV Import**: Import stands from CSV files with validation
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for bulk operations
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting with row-level feedback
- **Rollback Support**: Ability to rollback failed bulk operations
- **Template Integration**: Apply capability templates during bulk import

#### 2. Real-time Updates
- **Live Data Sync**: Real-time updates across all connected clients
- **Event Broadcasting**: Notify dependent systems of stand changes
- **Status Notifications**: Real-time status change notifications
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent access gracefully

#### 3. Data Validation
- **Business Rule Validation**: Enforce business rules and constraints
- **Capability Validation**: Leverage existing capability validation framework
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure referential integrity and data consistency
- **Format Validation**: Validate data formats and required fields
